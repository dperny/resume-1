Dear eTech Staff,

My name is Drew Erny. I am a senior Computer Science student here at the
University of Alabama, and I am applying for the position of Systems Technician
Student Assistant. I previously worked at eTech in Spring of 2013 as a
Technology Assistant under Steven Gregory and Jason Miller. I left at the end
of that semester to focus on research and my classes.  Now, as a Senior, I have
plenty of time an no important classes left to take, and I would love to come
back to eTech to work in this new position. I can start immediately, and will
be in town for most of this winter break, if you would like to schedule an
interview then.

Thanks,

Drew Erny
